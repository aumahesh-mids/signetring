\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we presented \name, an unbiased and uninterested system for sharing digital objects that ensures authenticity and preserves the confidentiality of the sources. We implemented a proof-of-concept (POC) system and showed how a challenge protocol (like the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange \cite{dh-key-exchange}) could provide mutual authentication for owners and publishers. Our POC certified digital objects upon creation and preserved their lineage. While there are circumstances outside the scope of \name that allow fake objects to be created, \name provides the framework for authentic and confidential sharing of digital objects. We discussed several open problems and opportunities for enhancements in Section \ref{sec:discussion}. Bringing \name to production by integrating with third-party applications using connectors is the essential first step towards our goal.
