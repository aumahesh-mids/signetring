Outside working hours, clinical photography services are often limited. Our Trust has introduced a Secure Clinical Image Transfer (SCIT) app allowing clinicians to take photographs on personal devices to be securely uploaded to the patient’s electronic health record. To evaluate whether clinicians were taking clinical images in an insecure manner, clinicians completed an anonymous questionnaire before and after introduction of the SCIT app. The standard was 100% knowledge of, and adherence to, trust information governance guidelines. Response rate was 100% in both cycles. Introduction of the SCIT app reduced inappropriate clinical photography on personal devices. Our completed audit cycle shows that the SCIT app allows convenient, secure information capture on personal devices and automatic secure synchronisation to trust electronic health records.}

This data structure is at the hearth of many important tasks in computational biology. High-throughput sequencing of DNA can produce very large k-mer sets, in the size of billions of strings—in such cases, the memory consumption and query efficiency of the data structure is a concrete challenge.To tackle this problem, we describe a compressed and associative dictionary for k-mers, that is: a data structure where strings are represented in compact form and each of them is associated to a unique integer identifier in the range [0,n). We show that some statistical properties of k-mer minimizers can be exploited by minimal perfect hashing to substantially improve the space/time trade-off of the dictionary compared to the best-known solutions.https://github.com/jermp/sshash.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

abstract="As the emergence of various social media, short texts, such as weibos and instant messages, are very prevalent on today's websites. In order to mine semantically similar information from massive data, a fast and efficient matching method for short texts has become an urgent task. However, the conventional matching methods suffer from the data sparsity in short documents. In this paper, we propose a novel matching method, referred as semantically similar hashing (SSHash). The basic idea of SSHash is to directly train a topic model from corpus rather than documents, then project texts into hash codes by using latent features. The major advantages of SSHash are that 1) SSHash alleviates the sparse problem in short texts, because we obtain the latent features from whole corpus regardless of document level; and 2) SSHash can accomplish similar matching in an interactive real time by introducing hash method. We carry out extensive experiments on real-world short texts. The results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline methods on several evaluation metrics.",

abstract = {Voice over IP (VoIP) has become a popular protocol for making phone calls over the Internet. Due to the potential transit of sensitive conversations over untrusted network infrastructure, it is well understood that the contents of a VoIP session should be encrypted. However, we demonstrate that current cryptographic techniques do not provide adequate protection when the underlying audio is encoded using bandwidth-saving Variable Bit Rate (VBR) coders. Explicitly, we use the length of encrypted VoIP packets to tackle the challenging task of identifying the language of the conversation. Our empirical analysis of 2,066 native speakers of 21 different languages shows that a substantial amount of information can be discerned from encrypted VoIP traffic. For instance, our 21-way classifier achieves 66\% accuracy, almost a 14-fold improvement over random guessing. For 14 of the 21 languages, the accuracy is greater than 90\%. We achieve an overall binary classification (e.g., "Is this a Spanish or English conversation?") rate of 86.6\%. Our analysis highlights what we believe to be interesting new privacy issues in VoIP.},
