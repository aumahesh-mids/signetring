abstract = {Clinical photographs aid decision-making and represent important medicolegal records. Storage and transfer of images of the facial area must adhere to Caldicott Principles. Outside working hours, clinical photography services are often limited. Our Trust has introduced a Secure Clinical Image Transfer (SCIT) app allowing clinicians to take photographs on personal devices to be securely uploaded to the patient’s electronic health record. To evaluate whether clinicians were taking clinical images in an insecure manner, clinicians completed an anonymous questionnaire before and after introduction of the SCIT app. The standard was 100% knowledge of, and adherence to, trust information governance guidelines. Response rate was 100% in both cycles. Introduction of the SCIT app reduced inappropriate clinical photography on personal devices. Our completed audit cycle shows that the SCIT app allows convenient, secure information capture on personal devices and automatic secure synchronisation to trust electronic health records.}
